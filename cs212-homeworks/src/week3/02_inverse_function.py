# --------------
# User Instructions
#
# Write a function, inverse, which takes as input a monotonically
# increasing (always increasing) function that is defined on the 
# non-negative numbers. The runtime of your program should be 
# proportional to the LOGARITHM of the input. You may want to 
# do some research into binary search and Newton's method to 
# help you out.
#
# This function should return another function which computes the
# inverse of the input function. 
#
# Your inverse function should also take an optional parameter, 
# delta, as input so that the computed value of the inverse will
# be within delta of the true value.

# -------------
# Grading Notes
#
# Your function will be called with three test cases. The 
# input numbers will be large enough that your submission
# will only terminate in the allotted time if it is 
# efficient enough.
